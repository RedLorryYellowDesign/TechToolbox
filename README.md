Introduction
  This GitHub Repo is insteded to act as a how to gide for the mainy technical topics I study. I have made this public in the hopes it might help other but please note this is mainly for my own use and thus is structure to meet my needs. It may not cover every topics and might omit areas I dont feel I need to record. In adition while I will always attempt to have correct infomation you should always check the orignal documentation if somthing dosnt work as exspected. If you do notice a mistake or would like to help build this reop you are more than welcome to add you own commits.

Data Sorces
  I will be including linke, asstes and other items from 3rd party sorces. I will always refracne if the infomation is sorces from a 3rd party e.g. form another repo. I will also produce my own notes to support and suplent these resorces however.

Jupyter Notebooks
  I quite like producing note in Jupyter as it allows for a very clean and clear method of recording notes when Python is being used. I will have a folder relating to Jupyter in the DataSciance Section but if you dont with to do the setup VS code offers a Jupter Notebook plug in and Google Colab is also compatable.
